This project was designed to help fulfill a problem that I noticed in my everyday life! Recently I started the new hobby of crab fishing in Washington State. I realized that all of the reporting for this sport was done manually and I wanted to streamline the process.

The main function of this project allows users to create, read, update and delete catch records. Once created the records are stored in a MySQL database and can be queried by the admin to sort through data as they see fit. 

Because of the nature of the website, to create a record a user must be logged in and create an account. This part of the website features vailidations as outlined in the video. 

I used Bootstrap in addition to a theme picker to quickly style the frontend and color palette of this project.
